Observations:

We implemented 3 behaviors: one for driving forward, 
one for avoiding the black edge and one for detecting 
objects and avoiding collision with them.

For the driving forward behavior we basically make both
motors drive forward.

For avoiding the black edge we fetch light sensor samples
and if they are smaller than 0.5 it means it detected the 
black edge so it tries to turn around.

For detecting objects and avoiding collision we use both
touch sensor samples and ultrasonic sensor samples. If 
one of the touch sensor samples (left or righ) are 
bigger than 0 or if  the distance sample is smaller than 0.25
we detect an object. The response is turning in order to avoid it.
